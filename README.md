*note: Unfortunately, the n8n workspace requires a subscription to keep using it, so the bot is not avaliable to test now becuse i don't have any n8n plan,
but that file is the structure of the project, all you need to do it's change all the required credencials with yours then the bot will properly work.

This bot was made by an attempt of trying to get a job vacancy at B2BIT COMPANY - Software house Natal. Unfortunately, i didn't make it becuse of a little gap that i completely forgot.
The gap was "return both the file and the file's public link" in the "/1" and "/2" section, and for some reason i just returned the file public link thinking it was fine :(.
Anyways, that was one of my first "huge" projects and i loved to work on it, i improved a lot my knowledge during this and it certainly made me stroger and more prepared for my next attempts :).
